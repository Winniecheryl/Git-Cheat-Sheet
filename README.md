# Git-Cheat-Sheet

This is a simple guide on how to use various git commands. 

I will share with you both screenshots and codes for clarity.

Let me take you through the steps of creating a new repository on github, if you have never used Command prompt to create a repository, this lesson is what you need.

The first command is the `git init` command. This will create a new git repository or convert a project you have been working on into a git repository

After creating a repository you will need a readme file for your repsitory, use `git add README.md` to create your readme.

`git commit -m` command is what you will use next, this is to record all the changes you make in your repository. You can also add a simple message like this, `git commit -m "This is my initial commit" `
